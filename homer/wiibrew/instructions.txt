Instructions:

*Note* If Windows defender interrupts the unzipping of these files then turn off windows defender real-time protection and unzip again.
The actual exploit payloads are thought to be viruses by windows defender. Alternatively, you can just add an exception inside of your antivirus.


1. Install XAMPP to a local PC on the same local network that the Wii U is on
   (xampp installer included in the "PC Software" folder)
2. Browse to "c:\xampp\htdocs\" and copy the "WiiU" from the zip inside there

   Folder should look like:	
   - c:\xampp\htdocs\WiiU\553
			 \cafiine\...
                         \hbl\...
                         \kexploit\...
			 \loadiinegx2\...
			 \mocha\...
			 \removeupdate\...
                         \res\...
			 \sdcafiine\...
                         index.html
			 index532.html
			 index540-553.html
                         menu.json
                         menu.json.txt

3. Copy everything INSIDE of folder "SD Card" to the root of your SD card overwriting files when prompted.
4. Put SD card back in WiiU
5. Turn on Apache in XAMPP
6. Test website on local PC by opening a browser (Chrome or another) and go to:
   localhost/WiiU

*Note* If you cannot see the web page on your local PC then you may have a port issue with XAMPP. Post
       in gbatemp thread with issues. You must have the xampp page working before you can test on Wii U.

7. Learn your local PC's IP address and use that in the next step.

*Note* On windows, click start, write "cmd" on search bar, and run "cmd.exe". On there, write "ipconfig". Look for the Ipv4 line. That will be your local address.

8. Open your Wii U and open the browser. Click on settings in the upper right corner. Click "Reset Save Data". Now browse the web page:
   http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/WiiU 

*Note* Replace the "xx" with your local IP from step 7

9. You should see the main exploit page loaded. Proceed to the one for your Wiiu's firmware

*Note* If you change the port number in xampp to make it work then you need to include that in the URL
example:
If you change port to "12345". The address you should use in Wii U browser is:
http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:12345/WiiU

*Note* If you want to trick your Wii U into loading the same page every time that you open the browser follow these steps:

1. Let's say I want to load the main exploit page every time by default. First turn off your server. (or just turn off wifi)
2. Open the browser and type in the direct link for your exploit (http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/WiiU/)
3. The page will fail (if you have your webserver off or ethernet disconnected or wifi turned off)
4. Press the Home button on the wii U
5. Press Wii U Menu
6. Open Mii Maker and let it load.
7. Exit Mii Maker with the button in the bottom left

Now every time you open your browser it will go to that link immediatly. You can cancel this by following the same steps for a different link.
